# Getting started testing the Physical Web

In order to get up and running you need two things:

1. A hardware beacon (or two) that supports [Eddystone-URL](https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/eddystone-url) advertisement packets.
2. Software on your phone/tablet to scan for Eddystone-URL advertisement packets.

The software is easy thing to take care of once you have beacons. There is a Physical Web demo app on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=physical_web.org.physicalweb) as well as the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/physical-web/id927653608?mt=8).  A walkthrough of the app [is here](http://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/android_client_walkthrough.md).

Keep in mind that this software is just a prototype. We are doing it this way to easily and quickly test the concept.
