## Wi-Fi Direct Support

[Wi-Fi Direct](http://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-direct) allows devices to connect directly rather than through an Access Point. This way, a device can connect and received data through a peer-to-peer connection rather than over the internet. With Wi-Fi Direct, the Physical Web will allow beacons to broadcast and serve data to users. The advantage this provides is allowing devices without internet connectivity to access data.

Broadcast instructions:

To "broadcast", a device must be in a Wi-Fi Direct discoverable state.
In addition, the device name must conform to the following naming convention: `PW-<title>-<port>`

`<title>` is the title of the content. `<port>` is the port the HTTP service is running at.
