## Physical Web Service Support

The Physical Web app comes configured to use Google's internal Physical Web Service (PWS), but you can choose to use other services as well. The app has built in support for 3 different services; Google's internal PWS, the production open source PWS, and the development open source PWS.

Google's internal PWS is the same PWS that Chrome uses. The production open source PWS is the one previously used for the app. The development open source PWS is for experimental features. In most cases users will want to select from the Google PWS or the Production PWS.

The app also allows for a custom PWS. To configure a custom PWS you will need to; select the Custom Physical Web Service from the list of Physical Web Service, add a Custom Physical Web Service URL, select the Custom Physical Web Service API version, and if selecting version 2 or higher an API key is needed.
